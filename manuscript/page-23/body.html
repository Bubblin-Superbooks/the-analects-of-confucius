complete virtue in his food does not seek to gratify his appetite, nor</p><p>in his dwelling place does he seek the appliances of ease; he is
earnest in what he is doing, and careful in his speech; he frequents
the company of men of principle that he may be rectified:— such a
person may be said indeed to love to learn.'</p></div> </div>
