reverence their ruler, to be faithful to him, and to go on to nerve
themselves to virtue. The Master said, 'Let him preside over them
with gravity;— then they will reverence him. Let him be filial and
kind to all;— then they will be faithful to him. Let him advance the
good and teach the incompetent;— then they will eagerly seek to be
virtuous.'</p></div> </div>
