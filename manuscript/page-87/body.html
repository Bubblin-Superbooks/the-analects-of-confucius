<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h5>Vi.</h5><p>A high officer asked Tsze-kung, saying, 'May we
not say that your Master is a sage? How various is his ability!'
 Tsze-kung said, 'Certainly Heaven has endowed him
unlimitedly. He is about a sage. And, moreover, his ability is
various.'
 The Master heard of the conversation and said, 'Does the
high officer know me? When I was young, my condition was low,
and therefore I acquired my ability in many things, but they were
mean matters. Must the superior man have such variety of ability?
He does not need variety of ability.'
 Lao said, 'The Master said, "Having no official employment,
I acquired many arts."'</p><h5>Vii.</h5><p>The Master said, 'Am I indeed possessed of
knowledge? I am not knowing. But if a mean person, who appears
quite empty-like, ask anything of me, I set it forth from one end to
the other, and exhaust it.'</p></div> </div>
