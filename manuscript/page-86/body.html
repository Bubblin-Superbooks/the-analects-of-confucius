loved virtue, or one who hated what was not virtuous. He who
loved virtue, would esteem nothing above it. He who hated what is
not virtuous, would practise virtue in such a way that he would not
allow anything that is not virtuous to approach his person.
 'Is any one able for one day to apply his strength to virtue?
I have not seen the case in which his strength would be insufficient.
 'Should there possibly be any such case, I have not seen it.'</p></div> </div>
