have their brothers, I only have not.'
 Tsze-hsia said to him, 'There is the following saying which I
have heard:—</p><p>'"Death and life have their determined appointment; riches
and honours depend upon Heaven."
 'Let the superior man never fail reverentially to order his
own conduct, and let him be respectful to others and observant of
propriety:— then all within the four seas will be his brothers. What
has the superior man to do with being distressed because he has no
brothers?'</p></div> </div>
