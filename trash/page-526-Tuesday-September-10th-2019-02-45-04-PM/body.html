Confucius, singing and saying, 'O FANG! O FANG! How is your</p><p>virtue degenerated! As to the past, reproof is useless; but the future
may still be provided against. Give up your vain pursuit. Give up
your vain pursuit. Peril awaits those who now engage in affairs of
government.'
 Confucius alighted and wished to converse with him, but
Chieh-yu hastened away, so that he could not talk with him.</p></div> </div>
