study the Book of Poetry?
 'The Odes serve to stimulate the mind.
 'They may be used for purposes of self-contemplation.
 'They teach the art of sociability.
 'They show how to regulate feelings of resentment.
 'From them you learn the more immediate duty of serving
one's father, and the remoter one of serving one's prince.
 'From them we become largely acquainted with the names
of birds, beasts, and plants.'</p></div> </div>
