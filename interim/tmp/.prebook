While he\nlived, he would be glorious. When he died, he would be bitterly\nlamented. How is it possible for him to be attained to?'"

If there shall be distress and want within the four seas,\nthe Heavenly revenue will come to a perpetual end.'\n Shun also used the same language in giving charge to Yu.\n T'ang said, 'I the child Li, presume to use a dark-coloured\nvictim, and presume to announce to Thee, O most great and\nsovereign God, that the sinner I dare not pardon, and thy ministers,\nO God, I do not keep in obscurity. The examination of them is by\nthy mind, O God. If, in my person, I commit offences, they are not to\nbe attributed to you, the people of the myriad regions. If you in the\nmyriad regions commit offences, these offences must rest on my\nperson.'\n Chau conferred great gifts, and the good were enriched.\n 'Although he has his near relatives, they are not equal to\nmy virtuous men. The people are throwing blame upon me, the One\nman.'\n He carefully attended to the weights and measures,\nexamined the body of the laws, restored the discarded officers, and\nthe good government of the kingdom took its course.\n He revived States that had been extinguished, restored\nfamilies whose line of succession had been broken, and called to\noffice those who had retired into obscurity, so that throughout the\nkingdom the hearts of the people turned towards him.\n What he attached chief importance to, were the food of the\npeople, the duties of mourning, and sacrifices.\n By his generosity, he won all. By his sincerity, he made the\npeople repose trust in him. By his earnest activity, his\nachievements were great. By his justice, all were delighted."

The Master replied, 'Let him honour the five\nexcellent, and banish away the four bad, things;— then may he\nconduct government properly.' Tsze-chang said, 'What are meant by\nthe five excellent things?' The Master said, 'When the person in\nauthority is beneficent without great expenditure; when he lays\ntasks on the people without their repining; when he pursues what\nhe desires without being covetous; when he maintains a dignified\nease without being proud; when he is majestic without being fierce.'\n Tsze-chang said, 'What is meant by being beneficent\nwithout great expenditure?' The Master replied, 'When the person\nin authority makes more beneficial to the people the things from\nwhich they naturally derive benefit;— is not this being beneficent without\ngreat expenditure? When he chooses the labours which are proper,\nand makes them labour on them, who will repine? When his desires\nare set on benevolent government, and he secures it, who will\naccuse him of covetousness? Whether he has to do with many\npeople or few, or with things great or small, he does not dare to\nindicate any disrespect;— is not this to maintain a dignified ease\nwithout any pride? He adjusts his clothes and cap, and throws a\ndignity into his looks, so that, thus dignified, he is looked at with\nawe;— is not this to be majestic without being fierce?'\n Tsze-chang then asked, 'What are meant by the four bad\nthings?' The Master said, 'To put the people to death without having\ninstructed them;— this is called cruelty. To require from them,\nsuddenly, the full tale of work, without having given them\nwarning;— this is called oppression. To issue orders as if without\nurgency, at first, and, when the time comes, to insist on them with\nseverity;— this is called injury. And, generally, in the giving pay\nor rewards to men, to do it in a stingy way;— this is called acting\nthe part of a mere official.'"
